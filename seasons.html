      <p>In Kamchatka, Russian guards are instructed to feed a prisoner, but "not the American", to a captured
        Demogorgon. This season is split between 3 main groups and there seperate places: Hawkins, California, and
        Russia. At Hawkins, Vecna becomes strong and starts killing people. Elevan and the Byers family are finding it
        hard to adjust to California. Joyce leaves for Alaska and then Russia to save Hopper. They must stop Vecna
        before he takes his fourth victim-Max. If he achieves this, Max will be dead and he will have the power to take
        over the world. In his enclosed, smoke-red mindscape, Eleven takes over Vecna. At that time Nancy, Steve, and Robin were also liting him on fire from the normal side.</p>
