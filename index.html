  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>Stranger Things is set in the fictional rural town of Hawkins, Indiana, during the 1980s. The nearby Hawkins
    National Laboratory ostensibly performs scientific research for the United States Department of Energy, but secretly
    does experiments into the paranormal and supernatural, including those that involve human test subjects.
    Inadvertently, they have created a portal to an alternate dimension, "the Upside Down." The influence of the Upside
    Down starts to affect the unknowing residents of Hawkins in calamitous ways. The fifth season is going to be the
    last season to wrap the entire series together. So there have been 4 seasons and 38 episodes. Click on the
    respective boxes to learn more about the specific <a class="link" href=seasons.html>season</a> in more deapth.</p>
